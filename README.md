# CSE â€“ 535 Information Retrieval Multi-topic Information Retrieval Chatbot Project

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a web-based chatbot employing technologies that reveal information retrieval techniques. The major goal is to enable user interaction with the chatbot through input and to train the chatbot with the proper techniques so that it can generate responses. 

## CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY 
- HTML and cascading style sheets (CSS) have been developed for the application's front-end, and the UI interface has been built. 
- The web page structure has been used for the hypertext mark up language. 
- The word cloud was used to visualize the text, and we linked our front end interface to the backend using the flask application. 
- Flask is a web framework that provides libraries for creating lightweight Python web applications.
