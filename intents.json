                "Most sources of air pollution are structural and embedded in the economic processes underpinning modern society. Even in countries and communities with strong air pollution policies, individuals may not always have access to technologies or e.g., transportation options to meaningfully impact air pollution on their own. It will take a collective effort.",
                "Air pollution is all around us. Most people in the world live in areas with high levels of air pollution. It harms human health and wellbeing, reduces quality of life, and can negatively impact the economy and ecosystems. These impacts also disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people and communities.",
                "Air pollution is caused by gases and particles emitted to the atmosphere by a variety of human activities, such as the inefficient combustion of fuels, open burning of waste, agriculture, and farming. There are also natural sources contributing to air pollution, many of which are impacted by human activities such as forest fires, soil dust and salt in sea spray.",
                "Air pollution has been associated with humans for millennia, starting with the use of fire for cooking and warmth. Dangerously high levels of outdoor air pollution became a problem during the industrial revolution, where the massive use of coal gave rise to many episodes of serious urban air pollution.",
                "Air pollution comes from a wide array of sources, both natural and caused by human activities (anthropogenic). Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, sea spray, soil dust, natural vegetation fires and lightning. Some of the most common human activity-related sources include power generation, transportation, industry, residential heating and cooking, agriculture, solvent use, oil and gas production, waste burning and construction. Some sources, such as forest and savanna fires, and windblown mineral dust, occur naturally, but are exacerbated by human activities.",
                "Air pollution significantly impacts places near its source, but because it can be carried long distances in the atmosphere, air pollution created in one place, can also affect faraway places. For example, pollutants that form into fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ozone (O 3 ) can travel over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, causing regional and continental impacts.",
                "The air pollutant of greatest concern for human health, and for which there is the strongest evidence is fine particulate matter. This has a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, also known as PM 2.5 . These fine particles are invisible to the human eye and 40 times smaller than the width of a human hair.",
                "Children are particularly vulnerable to the damaging health effects of air pollution due to their unique susceptibility and exposure: Children’s respiratory tracts are more permeable, their breathing rate is twice as much as adults, and they take in more air per kilogram (kg) of their body weight. Children’s bodies, especially their lungs and brains, are still developing, with narrower blood vessels.",
                "While all individuals experience different levels of health impacts from air pollution, across large city or country populations, there is no evidence of a completely safe level of air pollution, especially in the case of particulate matter and NO 2 .",
                "Some air pollutants cause ‘acid rain’, a problem that received particular focus in Europe and North America in the 1980s and 90s. Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water in the atmosphere, producing sulphuric acid and nitric acid that return to earth as acid rain.",
                "Air pollution and climate change are inherently linked. All major air pollutants have an impact on the climate and most share common sources with greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially related to the combustion of fossil fuels. They also aggravate each other in multiple ways."
